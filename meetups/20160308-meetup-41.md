#### Summary

We are going to build a Rails 5 application step by step. We are going to cover the basics, but the application is going to work. This will give you the opportunity to see how to use Rails to build web applications. You will learn the basic steps, and it will be really easy to go back home and start experimenting immediately!

Plus, we are going to show you how to deploy it to Heroku, so that people can start using it from all over the world. Piece of cake.
