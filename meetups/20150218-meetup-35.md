We will take a look and the basic DSL offered by rake, some working examples alongside some lessons learned from using rake to build everything from gems to embedded C/C++ systems. If time allows we will delve into extending the provided DSL and check how this was done for Capistrano v3.

#### About the speaker

Vassilis Rizopoulos has been dabbling in software engineering for over 15 years now. In this decade and a half what started as a hobby of a would-be electrical engineer became full time occupation. He specializes in "software productivity engineering", a catch all term for the role that integrates the development environment, test automation, continuous integration and deployment, devops and general behind the scenes tooling that enables software teams to concentrate on actually producing useful software. His language of choice is Ruby and has been for the past dozen of years, but he also has several C and C++ embedded projects under his belt as well as a few C# .NET projects. Most of his professional career has been spent working for large industry firms doing really close to the metal stuff, from devices smaller than an Oreo cookie to as large as 60-ton locomotives. He is one of the co-founders and organizers of [thessaloniki.rb](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/117820512877082997368/117820512877082997368/posts) the Thessaloniki Ruby Users group and also had the luck to be part of the organizing committee for [EuRuKo 2013](http://euruko2013.org) that took place in Athens. Whatever free time remains between deadlines and family life goes into open source projects mainly in the Ruby community with the lion's share reserved for [rutema](http://github.com/damphyr/rutema)
