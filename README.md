## This Tuesday @ 19:00 [Meetup 40](https://git.io/vz8fJ) - Happy Anniversary thessrb! You turn 40!

### Thessaloniki Ruby Meetup (thessrb)

thessrb is a group of (not just) geeks, who love Ruby (among other things),
live (not just) in Thessaloniki (Greece), and meet at least once a month to
throw some presentations (sometimes), and continue with a halaruby (every time).

Halaruby is us leaving the presentation site, and going to a place to have
beverages, chat, and network.

### When do you meet?

We have at least one meetup every month. Here are some ways to find out when the
